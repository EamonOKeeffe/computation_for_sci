    "# Climate Change Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are going to use Python to investigate climate change. You will be given a dataset consisting of atmospheric CO$_2$ levels in ppm (parts per million) since 800,000 BC. CO$_2$ is a greenhouse gas which contributes to the greenhouse effect. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be quite chilly at around -18°C, instead of the much more pleasant current average of 15°C. \n",

    "Humans have been contributing more and more CO$_2$ to the atmosphere every year since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. \n",
