    "A common laboratory skill is to create a solution with a desired concentration by diluting a stock solution with some amount of solvent. Given a stock solution with volume $V_1$ that has a concentration of solute $C_1$, the problem is to know how much solvent to add to arrive at the desired concentration, $C_2$.\n",
