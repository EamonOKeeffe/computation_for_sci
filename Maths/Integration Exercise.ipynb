    "First recall that an integral is *the area under the curve.* \n",
    "\n",
    "How are we going to get the area under this curve? Well, while finding the area of a region bounded by a curve might be difficult, we *are* able to find the area of a rectangle pretty easily, that's just the width multiplied by the height. We could put some rectangles under the curve, and calculate the area of those instead. All we'll have to do is calculate the area of each individual rectangle and then add them all up. That would at least give us some estimate of the area we desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make life as simple as possible, we'll make the width of all of our rectangles equal. The total width of area we are trying to calculate is $15 - 5 = 10$. Lets start with rectangles which have a width of 2. This means we need 5 rectangles to fill our interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only other thing we need to figure out is the height of our rectangles. These heights shouldn't all be the same, they should in some way follow the function. Lets start by making the height of each rectangle the *value of the function at the left side of the rectangle.* (Note that we are making a choice here. We could also choose the right side of the rentangle, or even the middle of the rectangle, which turns out to be a better choice for reasons beyond the scope of this module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have decided what the height of each rectangle should be, lets calculate our estimate!\n",

    "Calculate the area using 5 rectangles to make your approximation.\n",
